ZL is a C compatible and C++ like programming language that focuses on
extensiblilty and giving the programmer control over how high-level
constructs (such as classes) are implemented.

ZL is being developed on Ubuntu 10.04, but it should work with any
Linux system.  Other Unix-like systems may work.

ZL uses the Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector, which
can be found at http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/.  It is
also available Ubuntu under the package names libgc1c2 and libgc-dev.

Also, in order to produce executable code, ZL requires a modified
version of gcc.  If this is a release than a patch file should have
been provided.  Most of the development has been done using gcc-4.4.0
however later versions of gcc-4.4.* should work provided that the
patch file applies cleanly.  Download gcc 4.4.0 from
ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases/gcc-4.4.0 (gcc-core is all that is
required) and apply the patch gcc-4.4.0-zl.patch.  When configuring
make sure you enable the zls language:

  tar xf gcc-core-4.4.0.tar.bz2
  mv gcc-4.4.0-src
  mkdir gcc-4.4.0
  mv gcc-4.4.0-src gcc-4.4.0/src
  pushd gcc-4.4.0/src
  patch -p0 < PATH_TO_PATCH/gcc-4.4.0-zl.patch # should apply cleanly
  popd
  mkdir gcc-4.4.0/obj
  cd gcc-4.4.0/obj
  ../src/configure --enable-languages=zls # --prefix=/opt/gcc-4.4-zl/
  make bootstrap
  make install
  sudo ln -s /opt/gcc-4.4-zl/bin/gcc /usr/local/bin/zls

The latest version of zls is also available in github at
https://github.com/kevina/zl-gcc.  Just checkout master and follow the
instructions above, but skip the patching part as the git
repository includes the full source.

ZL Build instructions:

  ./configure
  make
  # no need to install, in fact the install target is empty
  # use "make fake-install" to install a link to to zlc so you can
  # easily compile zl programs

To test ZL, make sure "zls" in your path and then:
  make -C test test

To create executable use the "zlc" perl script, which acts as a
drop-in replacement for cc/gcc and c++/g++.
